**Programs solved with backtracking algorithm**

  Because of time complexity and memory usage this algorithm is not the best to solve many problems. Even on some ocassions it may not find the optimal solution.
  However this algorithm works for this problems event though it uses a brute force search.

  1.-Sudoku
  
  2.-Check if two digraphs are isomorphic. 
      -Checks if it exists a bijective aplication between the vertices of one digraph with the other.
  
  3.-Knight's moves.
      - Checks if a knight can go to every square of the board without repeting any of them.
